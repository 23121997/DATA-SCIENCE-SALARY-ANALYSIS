# DATA-SCIENCE-SALARY-ANALYSIS


In recent years, data science has emerged as one of the most lucrative and in-demand fields in the tech industry. As a result, data science salaries have been on the rise, and understanding the factors that influence these salaries is critical for both employers and job seekers.

In this data science project, I aim to analyze data science salaries across different countries, industries, and job roles. By collecting and analyzing salary data from various sources, I will identify the factors that impact data science salaries and provide insights into how data scientists can maximize their earning potential.

he project will involve data collection, cleaning, and preparation, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical modeling. I will use Python and its data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Wordcloud, Pyplot and Matplotlib to perform the data analysis and visualization.

The project's findings will be presented in a detailed report, including visualizations and interactive dashboards. The report will be made available on my Github profile, providing a valuable resource for anyone interested in data science salaries analysis.
